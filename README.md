> Enterprise-grade astronomical computing platform enabling DESI research through hybrid Kubernetes/VM infrastructure.

This repository documents the Proxmox Astronomy Lab — a 7-node production cluster running hybrid RKE2 Kubernetes and strategic VMs for astronomical data science. We produce enhanced datasets and original research from public surveys, operating at organizational scale with enterprise infrastructure standards.

## 🔭 Background

This section provides context for the platform's purpose and design. If you're familiar with hybrid Proxmox/Kubernetes infrastructure, skip to [Quick Start](#-quick-start).

![proxmox-astronomy-lab-overview](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ee81fbb-32fc-4610-8eed-054b4afe3d4e)

The Proxmox Astronomy Lab serves as the compute foundation for [RadioAstronomy.io](https://github.com/radioastronomyio) research projects. The platform combines virtualization flexibility with container orchestration — VMs for persistent services (databases, file servers, GPU workloads) and Kubernetes for dynamic ML/AI pipelines.

Our primary workload is [DESI](https://www.desi.lbl.gov/) (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument) data analysis, processing tens of gigabytes of galaxy catalogs and spectral data. The infrastructure enables reproducible research at scale: PostgreSQL with pgvector for catalog queries, distributed Ray clusters for ML training, and GPU acceleration for model inference.

AI is embedded in 100% of our workflows, governed by a formal [NIST AI RMF](https://github.com/vintagedon/nist-ai-rmf-cookbook) implementation with model cards, risk scenarios, and multi-framework compliance mapping. We target CISv8 L1 as an achievable security baseline appropriate for a research platform.

## 🤖 AI Governance

AI is embedded throughout our workflows with formal governance based on the [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework). Our complete policy framework is published in the [NIST AI RMF Cookbook](https://github.com/vintagedon/nist-ai-rmf-cookbook).

### Governance Framework

| Component | Count | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Core Policies | 3 | AI governance, acceptable use, model registry |
| Technical Standards | 3 | Risk assessment, secure AI systems, transparency |
| Risk Scenarios | 10 | R01-R10 covering data egress, prompt injection, drift, etc. |
| Model Cards | 8 | Claude Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.2, Gemini Pro 2.5, and others |

### Compliance Alignment

| Framework | Scope |
|-----------|-------|
| NIST AI RMF | Full Govern/Map/Measure/Manage implementation |
| ISO/IEC 42001 | AI management system alignment |
| CIS Controls v8 L1 | Security baseline (in progress) |
| CIS-RAM | Risk assessment methodology |
| Colorado SB24-205 | AI disclosure and duty-of-care |
